# Shadi's Stylish NextJS Starter

This is a a blank NextJS starter project that includes:

- `styled-components` ðŸ’…
- `styles/GlobalStyles.js` which includes a CSS reset and CSS variables for colors.
- `lib/constants.js` which includes CSS breakpoints, colors, and font weights.
- `.prettierrc` with pre-defined Prettier formatting settings
- `.babelrc` with `babel-styled-components-plugin` to work with Next's SSR

To add Google fonts, add the `<link>` tag to the `<Head>` component in `pages/_document.js`.

To add a local font, add the font file to the `public/fonts` folder and add an `@import` rule in `styles/GLobalStyles.js`.
